# dbâ€™s planck layout

This is a layout for the grid planck, built with a few ideals in mind:

- Compromise between english and swedish. The most common digraphs in both languages are "rollable".
- Left hand selects layers.
- Numpad is available for right hand as a layer.
- Function buttons numbers are same as numpad numbers, extending F10-F12 to little finger collumn.  
- Arrows and pg up/down, home, end etc are available for right hand as a layer.
- Mouse is controlled like the arrows.

h
We have five layers.
A `BASE` layer, in dvorak;
a `MOVE` layer, with an arrow cluster, other movement keys, and hotkeys;
a `SYMB` layer, with numbers and symbols;
a `FUNC` layer, with am numpad;
a `MOUSE` layer, with mouse emulation. The `MOUSE` layer is activated by holding the Move and Symb keys simultaniously.
